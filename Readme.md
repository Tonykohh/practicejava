## Lyrics for the soul

-[x] verse one

writing lyrics everyday testing my mental fitness
writing everywhere that i go, streching my limits 
i have to prove to yall that
im not the same 
these rappers that you niggas stan are fucking lames
no rollie on the wrist no lambo or iced out chains
just a boy with a pen that could burn up a paper page
i hit the three at the end of the third quarter that mean i tripled the mil
at the end of october 
wasnt moved still, mama told me these women wouldnt show love if i aint foot bills
well fuck it i fuck around swallow the blue pill
-[x] hook
- you need to stop, you need start you need to go
- you need sing you need to eat how good your flow?
- if you believe youll achieve how far can you go?
- with what ive seen, there too many niggas that wanna control
## chorus
iggas wanna control me?(what?)
niggas wanna control me!!!! (we aint let it happen x2)
they wanna control me 
they aint never gon own me (big dawg)
